# ARC-AGI-solver

This project aims to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge using hypernetworks and attention mechanisms.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main entry point of the program
- `models/`: Contains neural network model definitions
  - `hypernetwork.py`: Implementation of the HyperNetwork
  - `main_network.py`: Implementation of the MainNetwork
- `data/`: Data handling and dataset implementation
  - `arc_dataset.py`: Implementation of the ARCDataset
- `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `train.py`: Training loop and related functions

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies (list them in a requirements.txt file)
3. Run `main.py` to start the training process
